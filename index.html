<h2>terrain and fishing in South Carolina</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fishing in South carolina is very unique. There are many different types of terrain in South Carolina</p>
<p>Theres flat land, mountain land, and hilly land. Also you can be right by the ocean one minute and </p>
<p>then drive two hours your in more hilly land as you get farther away, but drive another two hours</p>
<p>and your in complete mountains. It is for sure unique to its own. So what all of these different </p>
<p>terrains mean is different types of fishing for each terrain. For example on the coast of south</p>
<p>carolina you have salt water fishing, anywhere from Red Drum to Marlin. And then near more </p>
<p>of the midlands you have fishing in more swamp type areas for fish such as Largemouth Bass</p>
<p>and Catfish. And lastly you have fishing in the upstate where a lot of people go to catch Trout. </p>
<p>There are many types of Trout in South Carolina you can catch such as the Rainbow, Brook, </p>
<p>and Brown Trout. Dont get me wrong there are many other types of fishing in South Carolina, but </p>
<p>these seem to be the most popular</p>
